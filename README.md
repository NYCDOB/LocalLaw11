# Local Law 11 - Façade Safety and Inspection Program (FISP)

**To keep buildings safe, owners of properties higher than six stories must have exterior walls and
appurtenances inspected every five (5) years – and they must file a technical façade report with
the Department. See NYC Construction Codes §28-302.1 and RCNY §103-04. The current Façade Rule 
was last revised on November 11, 2021. See FAQs for information on 1RCNY 101-07 and 1RCNY 103-04.**
